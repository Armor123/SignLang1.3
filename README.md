Indian Sign Language to Text

The idea behind this app is aimed at bridging the gap between dumb and/or deaf persons and the rest of us. Communication is a huge issue when the other person is not well-versed and having an interpreter around all the time isn't feasible. 

Currently in India, a large part of the population suffers from these issues, may of them being illiterate, with very few certified sign language interpreters. ASL is the most widely accepted sign language with quite a few technologies catering to it, whereas in India a majority is acquainted with ISL only. 

The app will display a live camera preview, process the frames and display the corresponding result. It currently works for the alphabet. We would like to expand our scope further in due time.
